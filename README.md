Sheila Brear
UC Davis, Data Analytics Bootcamp, Module 2 Homework

1.	Purpose
The two purposes of this project are:
a.	To apply VBA code that was written for a small dataset (the selected stocks) to a much larger dataset (the entire stock market).
b.	To improve the efficiency of the code, while maintaining accuracy. (It was certainly much faster than me doing this by hand).

2.	Compare Stock Performance between 2017-2018 and Execution Times: It looks like the 2017 year was a much better year for generating income by purchasing stocks (probably not quite as goo as 2021, but better than 2022!).

3.	a. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refractoring code? 
The advantages are speed and accuracy, and being able to utilize this code repeatedly in different scenarios. The disadvantage is spending time writing the code, checking it repeatedly, and then making sure it is saved accurately. 

       3.b. How do these pros and cons apply to refractoring the original VBA script? 
It was incredibly confusing working through the original VBA code. I kept mixing up the old with the new, and if I took a break, I did not always start in the correct place. Once I was done, I could see it was well worth while, being able to see both the numbers, as well as a colored graphic (and good thing I am not color blind!).
